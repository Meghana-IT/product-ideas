# ✅ Solution – Trip Swap

Trip Swap is a peer-to-peer platform where:

- Sellers can upload their unused ticket details
- Buyers can browse and purchase verified tickets
- Both parties benefit:
  - Sellers get full value of the ticket
  - Buyers get access to tickets at original price

## How It Works
1. Seller lists ticket details (e.g., PNR, seat number, travel date)
2. System verifies authenticity (optional: photo upload or ID proof)
3. Buyer finds ticket using search filters (date, route)
4. Secure transaction is done through the platform
5. Seller receives payment once buyer confirms the ticket is valid
