# ðŸš€ Product Idea: Trip Swap

## Problem
Travelers often cancel pre-booked tickets (bus/train/flight) due to emergencies like work or health. Cancellation leads to financial loss. Meanwhile, other travelers face urgent travel needs but can't find tickets at the last minute.

## Solution
Trip Swap is a platform that allows users to *resell or swap their already booked tickets* to people looking for last-minute travel. This helps both the seller (who recovers money) and the buyer (who gets a ticket without overpaying or missing the journey).

## Key Features
- List and search emergency travel tickets
- Exact price purchase (no extra charges)
- Ticket verification via PNR/ID
- Secure transaction and notification system

## Impact
- Reduces cancellation loss
- Helps people in emergencies
- Promotes peer-to-peer trust-based travel solutions
